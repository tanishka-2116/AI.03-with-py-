# NumPy Basics

NumPy is a Python library used for working with numbers and arrays.
It is very useful in data analysis and machine learning.

## What I learned
- NumPy helps work with large data efficiently
- It provides arrays instead of normal Python lists
- Basic operations like sum, mean, max are easy

## Why NumPy is important for AI
- AI works with numerical data
- NumPy makes calculations faster
- Many ML libraries depend on NumPy

I will practice NumPy with small examples next.
