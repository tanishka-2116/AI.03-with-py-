# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms.
It is used to understand the relationship between two variables.

## What I understood
- It tries to fit a straight line through data points
- It is used for prediction
- Example: predicting marks based on study hours

## Why it is important
- It is the foundation of many ML algorithms
- Easy to understand and implement
- Helps in learning how models work

## Next Step
I will try a simple linear regression example using Python.
