# Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence where machines learn
from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

## What I learned
- Machine learning uses data to make predictions
- It improves performance with experience
- ML is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, etc.

## Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning  
   - Works with labeled data  
   - Example: predicting marks based on study hours  

2. Unsupervised Learning  
   - Works with unlabeled data  
   - Example: grouping similar data  

3. Reinforcement Learning  
   - Learns by trial and error  

## Next Step
I will start learning simple ML algorithms with examples.
